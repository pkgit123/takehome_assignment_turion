# Batch Analysis Approach for DDoS Detection

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for the batch processing portion of the Turion Data Engineering takehome assignment. We'll use Jupyter Notebooks for comprehensive analysis of the complete network traffic dataset.

## Why Jupyter Notebook for Batch Processing?

### âœ… **Advantages**

#### **1. Perfect for Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Interactive data exploration and visualization
- Easy to iterate on analysis approaches
- Great for understanding data quality issues and patterns
- Can quickly test different aggregation strategies

#### **2. Rich Visualization Capabilities**
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for comprehensive visualizations
- Easy to create attack pattern charts, traffic flow diagrams
- Can build interactive dashboards with widgets
- Perfect for showing time-series analysis of attacks

#### **3. Data Quality Assessment**
- Can systematically identify and document all the data quality issues mentioned in the assignment
- Easy to show before/after cleaning results
- Can quantify the impact of data quality problems

#### **4. Documentation and Reproducibility**
- Code and explanations in one place
- Easy to share results and methodology
- Can include markdown explanations of your approach
- Great for the "Analysis Results" deliverable requirement

## Suggested Notebook Structure

### **1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
```python
# Load the CSV and examine basic statistics
# Check data types and missing values
# Identify data quality issues
```

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
```python
# Handle missing values, malformed IPs, corrupted timestamps
# Remove duplicates and outliers
# Normalize data formats
```

### **3. Attack Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Time-series analysis of attack windows
# Traffic volume analysis by attack type
# Source IP analysis (top attackers)
# Port scanning detection
```

### **4. Statistical Analysis**
```python
# Aggregate statistics by time periods
# Protocol distribution analysis
# Geographic analysis (if country data is useful)
# Performance metrics calculation
```

### **5. Visualization Dashboard**
```python
# Attack timeline charts
# Traffic volume heatmaps
# Top attacker visualizations
# Performance metrics displays
```

## Integration with Streaming Pipeline

### **Recommended Architecture:**
- **Jupyter Notebook** = Batch processing and analysis
- **Streaming Script** = Real-time processing (separate Python script)
- **Shared Utilities** = Common data cleaning and detection logic

This gives you the best of both worlds - interactive analysis for batch processing and efficient streaming for real-time detection.

## Additional Benefits

### **1. Easy to Extend**
- Can quickly add ML data preparation sections
- Easy to implement bonus features like ML model training

### **2. Professional Presentation**
- Clean, documented analysis that's easy to review
- Perfect for demonstrating your analytical approach

### **3. Performance Testing**
- Can benchmark different processing approaches
- Easy to compare different aggregation strategies

### **4. Feature Engineering**
- Perfect for creating ML-ready datasets
- Can demonstrate ML data preparation for bonus points

## Key Analysis Areas

### **Attack Detection Rules to Implement:**
- High request rate from single IP (>100 requests/minute)
- Port scanning (single IP hitting many ports)
- Sudden traffic spikes (10x normal volume)
- Slowloris attacks (many incomplete connections)

### **Data Quality Issues to Address:**
- Missing values (timestamps, IPs)
- Malformed IP addresses
- Corrupted fields
- Duplicate records
- Outliers and anomalies

### **Metrics to Calculate:**
- Requests per IP per minute
- Traffic volume over time
- Protocol distribution
- Geographic distribution
- Attack type classification accuracy

## Expected Deliverables

### **From Batch Analysis:**
- Comprehensive data quality report
- Attack pattern visualizations
- Statistical summaries
- Performance metrics
- Top attacker identification
- Historical trend analysis

### **Integration Points:**
- Shared data cleaning functions
- Common detection rule definitions
- Consistent schema definitions
- Performance benchmarks for streaming comparison
