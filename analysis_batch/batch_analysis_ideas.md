# Batch Analysis Ideas and Getting Started Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines concrete ideas and strategies for implementing the batch processing portion of the Turion Data Engineering takehome assignment. Based on the requirements and the existing batch analysis approach, here are 2-3 specific ways to begin the batch analysis work.

## ðŸŽ¯ Three Concrete Starting Ideas

### **ðŸ“Š Idea 1: Comprehensive Data Quality Assessment Notebook**

**Why this is perfect to start with:**
- The assignment specifically mentions data quality issues as a key requirement
- It's foundational - you need clean data before meaningful analysis
- It demonstrates your attention to data quality (important for production systems)
- It's a clear, measurable deliverable

**What to build:**
```python
# 01_data_quality_assessment.ipynb
- Load the full network_traffic.csv
- Systematic analysis of missing values, malformed IPs, corrupted timestamps
- Quantify the impact of data quality issues
- Create before/after cleaning visualizations
- Document all findings with clear metrics
```

**Key sections:**
- Data loading and basic statistics
- Missing value analysis by column
- IP address validation and malformed data detection
- Timestamp parsing and corrupted data identification
- Duplicate record analysis
- Outlier detection in numeric fields
- Summary report with impact assessment

**Expected deliverables:**
- Comprehensive data quality report with metrics
- Before/after cleaning visualizations
- Impact assessment of data quality issues
- Recommendations for data cleaning strategies

### **ðŸŽ¯ Idea 2: Attack Pattern Analysis Dashboard**

**Why this is compelling:**
- Directly addresses the core requirement of "historical analysis to understand attack patterns"
- Shows you can identify the specific attack types mentioned in the assignment
- Creates impressive visualizations for the deliverables
- Demonstrates both technical skills and business understanding

**What to build:**
```python
# 02_attack_pattern_analysis.ipynb
- Time-series analysis of the 4 attack windows (SYN flood, HTTP flood, UDP flood, amplification)
- Traffic volume analysis by attack type
- Source IP analysis (identify top attackers)
- Port scanning detection across the dataset
- Interactive visualizations showing attack evolution
```

**Key visualizations:**
- Attack timeline showing the 4 attack windows
- Traffic volume heatmaps by time and attack type
- Top attacker IP addresses with their attack patterns
- Port scanning analysis (IPs hitting multiple ports)
- Protocol distribution during attacks vs normal traffic

**Expected deliverables:**
- Interactive attack timeline dashboard
- Top attacker identification and analysis
- Attack pattern visualizations
- Statistical summaries by attack type
- Performance metrics during attack windows

### **ðŸŽ¯ Idea 3: Performance Metrics and ML Data Preparation Pipeline**

**Why this is strategic:**
- Addresses the bonus ML requirements
- Shows production-ready thinking (performance optimization)
- Creates reusable components for both batch and streaming
- Demonstrates advanced data engineering skills

**What to build:**
```python
# 03_ml_data_preparation.ipynb
- Feature engineering for ML models (time-based, statistical, behavioral features)
- Handle class imbalance (rare attacks vs normal traffic)
- Create train/test/validation splits
- Generate labeled datasets with proper data quality
- Performance benchmarking of different processing approaches
```

**Key features to engineer:**
- **Time-based**: Requests per second/minute/hour, time since last request
- **Statistical**: Rolling mean/std of packet sizes, entropy of ports accessed
- **Behavioral**: New IP detection, unusual port combinations
- **Network**: Packet size distributions, protocol ratios, flag patterns
- **Derived**: Rate of change, acceleration of request frequency

**Expected deliverables:**
- ML-ready feature datasets
- Class imbalance handling strategies
- Train/test/validation splits
- Performance benchmarks
- Feature importance analysis
